# -binary_pitch_keyboard
 Binary pitch keyboard adaptation based on Lorre-Mill "Keyed Mosstone"
A binarr pitch keyboard allows for playing of notes using a small set of key inputs. The state of the three keys determines the selected pitch. 
The patch here is based on the: http://lorre-mill.com/keymoss/. 
I've used the patch two explore:
1. Methods of address the notes for playbility and musical significance
2. How a system like this can be used for generative music from very simple rule sets, namely being on / off messages.
